## Key Insights from supply
Taking a look at the trends from the supply of bitcoin and ethereum 
Bitcoin has a max supply of 21 million and due to its limited supply it shows a strong store of value. Ethereum on the other side, doesn't have a supply limitation which gives it flexibility, but it’s less scarce compared to Bitcoin.

## Recommendation 
For long-term value, Bitcoin is a strong choice due to its limited supply and scarcity. Ethereum, having no supply limitation, is better for utility and innovation, but may offer less price stability. Consider Bitcoin for storing value and Ethereum for projects and contracts.
